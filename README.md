# Numerical-Methods
  A repo for different numerical experiments, such as Singular
Value Decomposition, Optimal Matrix Rotation and Image Compression,
using Principal Component Analysis. It is didactic purpose so, in
order to see what happens here, I suggest the next steps:
1) Download these files
2) Download Jupyter Notebook (preferably Ubuntu).
3) Download Octave or Matlab kernel for Jupyter (if you have
already installed Jupyter on Linux, then it will be easier than on
Windows).
